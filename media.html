    <p>
      Hello, my name is Helen Akabeli, a passionate, purpose-driven individual
      with a clear mission to make a lasting impact through creativity,
      innovation, and integrity. Whether I'm designing, writing, or leading, I
      bring energy and clarity to every challenge I face. My journey has shaped
      me into a resilient and resourceful person who values growth, connection,
      and authenticity.
    </p>

    <p>
      As a young African woman driven by vision and purpose, I blend design,
      strategy, and storytelling to make ideas come alive visually and
      meaningfully.

    <h2>How it all started:</h2>

    <p>
      My journey into tech began with a curiosity about how digital products are
      built and secured at scale. Working as a Technical Support Engineer, I
      gained firsthand insight into the challenges users and businesses face
      with technology infrastructures—ranging from system downtime to
      inefficient deployment practices.
    </p>

    <p>
      What started as curiosity became a journey of hands-on learning,
      fast-paced troubleshooting, and constant adaptation. I have grown from
      managing basic tech issues to confidently supporting complex networks,
      security protocols, and mission-critical environments. Every ticket taught
      me patience. Every system failure taught me resilience. And every solution
      reminded me why I chose this path—to make technology feel reliable,
      seamless, and human-centered.

    <h3>How it is going:</h3>

    <p>
      As technology evolves, so do I—always learning, always improving, and
      always ready for what’s next. This experience sparked a deeper interest in
      understanding the backend of modern systems, especially the cloud
      environments they run on.
    </p>

    <p>
      My journey has taught me resilience, creativity, and the power of
      continuous learning. Whether working solo or with a team, I bring clarity,
      depth, and passion to every challenge.
    </p>

    <h3>Why I Joined ALTSCHOOL Africa:</h3>

    <p>
      With a clear goal to deepen my technical expertise, transition fully into
      cloud, and become a key contributor to building scalable, reliable, and
      secure systems, I quickly realized that self-learning alone wasn’t enough.
      I needed structured guidance, a vibrant community, and real-world projects
      to sharpen my skills and align with global standards. ALTSCHOOL Africa
      stood out as the right platform to make this transition.
    </p>

    <p>
      The program’s hands-on, real-world approach—combined with a strong
      community of learners and mentors—offers the ideal environment for both
      learning and growth. It aligns with my belief that knowledge should be
      practical, collaborative, and adaptable to real-world scenarios.
    </p>

    <h3>A PIECE OF ME:</h3>

    <p>
      I am a thinker, a doer, and a relentless creator who turns vision into
      impact. I don’t just chase ideas—I bring them to life with intention,
      clarity, and heart.
    </p>

    <p>
      Every step I take is driven by purpose; every project is a chance to
      solve, to shift, and to spark something new. Whether I'm designing,
      writing, developing, or strategizing, I bring bold energy, sharp focus,
      and an obsessive attention to what matters most—results that resonate and
      stories that spark.
    </p>

    <p>
      I don’t wait for opportunity—I create them. This isn’t just work for
      me—it’s personal. It’s legacy.
    </p>

    <p>Let’s build something unforgettable!</p>
