        <h2>How it all started:</h2>
        <p>My Jouney into tech began with a curiosity about how digita products are built and secured at scale. Working as a technical support Engineer I gained firsthand insight into the challenges users and businesses face with the technology infractures raging from system downtime to inefficient deployment practices.</p>
<p>What started with a curiosity for how systems work became a journey of hands-on learning, fast-paced troubleshooting, and constant adaptation. I have grown from managing basic tech issues to confidently supporting complex networks, security protocols, and mission critical environments.
Every ticket taught me patience. Every system failure taught me resilience. And every solution reminded me why I chose this path to make technology feel reliable, seamless, and human-centered.</p>
